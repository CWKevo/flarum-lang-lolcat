# Flarum LOLCat Language Pack

LOLCat language pack for [Flarum](https://flarum.org).

### Beta.15 Progress:
I plan to support all extensions available at [FreeFlarum](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/7585) in the future.

### Installation:
```
composer require cwkevo/flarum-lang-lolcat
```

### Updating
```
composer update cwkevo/flarum-lang-lolcat
php flarum cache:clear
```

To be used as a joke (eg.: for April Fools, or as an easter egg).
